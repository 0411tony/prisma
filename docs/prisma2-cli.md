# Prisma 2 CLI

## Installation

Prisma 2 CLI currently requires [Node 10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) (or higher).

### Install with npm

```
npm install -g prisma2
```

### Install with Yarn

```
yarn global add prisma2
```

### The `postinstall` hook

When installing Prisma 2 CLI, a [`postinstall`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/cli/sdk/package.json#L13) hook is being executed. It downloads Prisma 2's query and migration [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engine). The query engine contains the [Prisma schema](./prisma-schema-file.md) parser which is used by the `prisma2 init` and the `prism2 generate` commands. The migration engine is used by all `prisma2 migrate` commands.

## Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI

Prisma 2 CLI supports [custom HTTP proxies](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/506). This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.

To activate the proxy, provide the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and/or `HTTPS_PROXY`. The behavior is very similar to how the [`npm` CLI handles this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy).

The following environment variables can be provided:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example `http://localhost:8080`
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example `https://localhost:8080`

> To get a local proxy, you can also use the [`proxy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy) module:

## Commands

### Setup and development

#### `prisma2 init`

Sets up a `prisma/schema.prisma` file in the current directory. See [https://pris.ly/d/getting-started](https://pris.ly/d/getting-started).

#### `prisma2 generate`

Invokes all generators defined in the Prisma schema file. For example, this creates the Prisma Client JS to interact with the underlying database. Read more about Prisma Client JS and its capabilities [here](./prisma-client-js/use-only-prisma-client-js.md).

#### `prisma2 introspect`

Introspects the database and generates a data model from it. Basically, it analyzes your (already existing) database and automatically creates the Prisma schema file for you. This is useful, if you already have an existing application and want to start using Prisma 2. Note that this command synchronizes your Prisma schema file according to your database structure; typically if you're not using Prisma Migrate to migrate your database.

### Migrations

> Ô∏è**Warning**: Prisma's migration functionality is currently in an **experimental** state. When using any of the commands below, you need to explicitly opt-in to that functionality via an `--experimental` flag that needs to be passed to a command, e.g. `prisma2 migrate save --name 'init' --experimental`

#### `prisma2 migrate save`

Creates a new migration based on changes on your data model. In this context, it automatically documents all changes (i.e., a `git diff`). All changes are only applied **locally** and are **not** applied to the database. However, the migration is already written into the `_Migration` table of your database (which stores your project's migration history).

#### `prisma2 migrate up`

Runs all migrations that have not been applied to the database yet. This command effectively "replays" all local changes to the database.

#### `prisma2 migrate down`

This command reverts a database migration. In turn, it creates a "compensation" migration that undoes previous changes.
