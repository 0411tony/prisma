# Prisma 2 feedback

Prisma 2 is currently running in _Preview_ and has a number of [limitations](./limitations.md). It is not yet considered production-ready! There will a _General Availability_ release later this year where we issue a stable and production-ready version.

## Avoiding future breaking changes

We are aware that we have been moving very fast and Prisma users had to endure a number of breaking changes since the initial Prisma release in January 2018. 

Our primary goal with Prisma 2 is to **minimize breaking changes in the future**. 

For that, a full rewrite of Prisma was necessary so that we can build upon a proper foundation to address the use cases and requirements that have been brought up by our community members over the past two years.

## Your opinion matters – a lot!

While Prisma 2 is running in Preview, you can still help us steer the high-level direction as well as figure out specifics of how Prisma should work! After we issue a stable release of Prisma 2 later this year, there will be a lot less leeway to incorporate major changes into Prisma 2. **Now is the right time to provide feedback!** 

There are multiple ways how you can provide feedback! See below for a number of different options.

### Informal and personal discussions on Slack

We have created a dedicated Slack channel for the pioneers that are exploring Prisma 2: [`#prisma2-preview`](https://prisma.slack.com/messages/CKQTGR6T0/). 

This Slack channel is mainly used for quick and informal conversation and personal exchange. If you have product feedback, questions or run into bugs, please be sure to persist these on GitHub (more info in the sections below).

We are trying to be as responsive as possible in that channel. Please join us, we'd love to see you there!

### Product feedback, feature requests and wild wishes on GitHub

As mentioned above, while Prisma 2 is running in Preview, there is still time to share _your opinion_ of how Prisma 2 should work.

Please make sure to persists any kind of product feedback, feature requests or wild wishes as a GitHub issue in the [`prisma2`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2) repository!
