# Prisma 2 feedback

Prisma 2 is currently running in _Preview_ and has a number of [limitations](./limitations.md). It is not yet considered production-ready! There will a _General Availability_ release later this year where we issue a stable and production-ready version.

## Avoid future breaking changes

We are aware that we have been moving very fast and Prisma users had to endure a number of breaking changes since the initial Prisma release in January 2018. 

Our primary goal with Prisma 2 is to **minimize breaking changes in the future**. 

For that, a full rewrite of Prisma was necessary so that we can build upon a proper foundation to address the use cases and requirements that have been brought up by our community members over the past two years.

## Your opinion matters – a lot!

While Prisma 2 is running in Preview, you can still help us steer the high-level direction as well as figure out specifics of how Prisma should work! After we issue a stable release of Prisma 2 later this year, there will be a lot less leeway to incorporate major changes into Prisma 2. **Now is the right time to provide feedback!**
